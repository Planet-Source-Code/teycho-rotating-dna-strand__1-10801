### Description

This is something I made in QB a few years back that I finally got around to porting to VB... Basically, it simulates a rotating strand of DNA... You could probably use it to add graphics to something...
 
### More Info
 
None required, but you can change many options: Bar Length, Number of Bars, Colors of Both Molecules, How far the molecules move, etc.

This is also a good example of how to use UDTs (User-Defined Types) for someone wanting to learn.

Nada...
